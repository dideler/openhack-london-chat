### Contribute

This is the code for the OpenHack London Chatroom.

It's built on an open source IRC client called [Shout](http://shout-irc.com).  
It's just a fork of Shout with some minor customizations, and hosted on Heroku.

Unfortunately development of Shout has stalled,
but we'll pull in any updates when they're available.

Have an idea or suggestion for how to improve the chatroom?
Please [open an issue] or pull request.
