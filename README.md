# [OpenHack London] Chatroom

### Visit http://openhack-london.herokuapp.com

or go to **#openhack-london** on **Freenode** from your favourite IRC client.

This room will be populated when an OpenHack London event is running.  
That's the **first Monday of each month from 18:30-21:00** (London time).

Come in and hang out, even if you're hacking from home!

This is the code for the OpenHack London Chatroom.

It's built on an open source IRC client called [Shout](http://shout-irc.com).  
It's just a fork of Shout with some minor customizations, and hosted on Heroku.

Unfortunately development of Shout has stalled,
but we'll pull in any updates from upstream when they're available.

If you have an ideas or suggestions for how to improve the chatroom,
please open an issue or pull request.
